# RPi-CamillaDSP

Intent of this project is to provide guidance for setting up [CamillaDSP](https://github.com/HEnquist/camilladsp) on a RPi4/5. There is a lot of good information scattered through [ASR](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/rpi4-camilladsp-tutorial.29656/), [DIYAudio](https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/camilladsp-cross-platform-iir-and-fir-engine-for-crossovers-room-correction-etc.349818/) and the [CamillaDSP GitHub](https://github.com/HEnquist/camilladsp) but there also appears to be a lot of apprehension. My goal is to give concrete examples of how to use CamillaDSP with a variety of hardware to ease some of that apprehension. This tutorial originally lived at ASR but in May 2024 I decided to migrate it to GitHub to make version management easier and provide a more universal location.

I realize this tutorial is long and looks daunting. I felt the same way when trying to figure this stuff out. My advice is to take it step by step, go slowly and ask questions. Some DIY projects are not worth the effort but this one is. At the end of this project you will have a DSP with almost unparalleled processing power in a very small form factor, easily configured via web interface, all at a very low cost compared to commercial options.

I would like to especially thank @HenrikEnquist for developing CamillaDSP. I’ve long been skeptical of computer-based DSP but CamillaDSP is a game changer. It runs on minimal hardware, is easy to interface with a variety of devices and is exceptionally well designed. I’ve replaced all of my miniDSP systems with RPi4s running CamillaDSP and could not be happier.

I am not a programmer or DSP expert, my primary motivation is finding better ways to implement DIY active speakers. If you see a better way of doing something or want further explanation please speak up! These instructions have been developed as I learned how to implement CamillaDSP and found better ways to set it up but I am always learning.

Prior to GitHub, I archived older versions of the tutorial at the links below.
